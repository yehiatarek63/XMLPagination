# XMLPagination
This is a project that reads XML data from URLs in an OPML File. It also has pagination that shows 5 feeds per page. Only the data needed in a page is fetched and parsed for quicker loading times on each request.
# Favourites Functionality
You can now choose to favourite a feed and access it in the favourites page. When you favourite a feed, its data is written to a cookie and you can access the feed in the favourites section.
